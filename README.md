 The project is an interactive system that helps job seekers to practice answering technical interview questions.

The project embraces cutting-edge AI technologies and is built with the following technologies:
ChatGPT API, AWS Polly and AWS Transcribe. Deepgram Stream API.

Generally speaking the project implements the "Talk to ChatGPT" feature.

In particular, users can select several topics that will be covered during the mock interview.
Based on chosen topics, my application requests technical questions from ChatGPT. Afterward, AWS Polly service is used to synthesize speech based on text provided by ChatGPT.
Next, the user starts answering the question. The user's speech is recorded and sent to Deepgram Stream API and AWS Transcribe services. 
Deepgram transcribes the realtime stream of user's speech and sends the text to my application to be displayed to the job seeker.
Finally, the text of the transcribed user's answer is sent back to ChatGPT to be evaluated. ChatGPT returns a feedback to the job seeker and my application stores all information in a database.

In order to run the backend part of the project locally, you will need to have AWS account with permissions to access AWS Polly, AWS Transcribe, AWS S3, as well as OPEN AI account, and Deepgram account.
Additionally, you would need to set up the following environment variables:
- AWS_REGION
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_STS_ROLE_ARN
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
- DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID
- MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
- DB_HOST
- DB_NAME
- DB_USERNAME
- DB_PASSWORD
- SMTP_USERNAME
- SMTP_PASSWORD

How to build and run the project locally:

Backend: should be running on **9090** port

`mvn clean package`

`java -jar target/boanerges-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`


Frontend: should be running on **8080** port

`npm ci`

`npm run build`

`npm run serve`

Alternately, you can run the project using Docker Compose:

`docker compose -f compose-dev.yml up`

To stop the project, press Ctrl + C and run the following command: `docker compose -f compose-dev.yml down`
